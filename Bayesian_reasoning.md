### **C. Relationship Between Age and Death by Motor Vehicle Accident (Prediction Before Looking at Data)**

I expect that the risk of death by **motor vehicle accidents** is **not uniform across all ages**. Instead, it is likely to be **higher in certain age groups**:

1. **Teenagers & Young Adults (16-25 years old): High Risk**
   - Young, inexperienced drivers may engage in **reckless driving** (e.g., speeding, drunk driving, distracted driving).
   - This age group is more **likely to take risks** and have **less-developed hazard perception skills**.
   - Peer pressure and **higher exposure to night driving** increase the likelihood of accidents.
   
2. **Middle-Aged Adults (26-60 years old): Moderate Risk**
   - More experienced drivers, typically more **cautious** and responsible.
   - However, some still commute daily and drive frequently, so risk is present.
   - Fatigue from long work hours and stress might contribute to some accidents.

3. **Elderly (65+ years old): Increasing Risk Again**
   - **Slower reflexes**, reduced vision, and cognitive decline can make it **harder to react quickly** to hazards.
   - More likely to experience **medical emergencies while driving** (e.g., heart attacks, strokes).
   - However, elderly people often **drive less frequently**, which may balance out their risk somewhat.

### **D. Relationship Between Age and Death by Drug Use (Prediction Before Looking at Data)**

I expect that deaths due to **drug use** will also follow a **non-uniform** pattern:

1. **Teenagers & Young Adults (15-30 years old): High Risk**
   - **Experimentation phase**: Young adults often experiment with drugs due to peer pressure, curiosity, or mental health struggles.
   - **Overdose risk is high** in this group due to **lack of awareness about drug potency**, especially with substances like opioids, fentanyl, and synthetic drugs.
   - Clubbing and party culture contribute to **higher substance abuse rates**.

2. **Middle-Aged Adults (30-50 years old): Sustained but Slightly Lower Risk**
   - Some may continue drug use, especially those with **long-term addictions**.
   - **Opioid crisis affects this group significantly**, as prescription painkillers can lead to **overdoses and long-term abuse**.
   - Stress from work, financial problems, and family life may contribute to **substance dependency**.

3. **Elderly (50+ years old): Lower Risk, but Some Exceptions**
   - Generally, drug abuse declines with age, but **prescription drug overdoses** (e.g., painkillers, sleeping pills, benzodiazepines) may still be an issue.
   - Elderly individuals are **less likely to abuse recreational drugs** but more likely to **experience accidental overdoses** from prescribed medications. 


### **F. Comparison between guess in C and D and histogram in E**

1. **Motor Vehicle Accident Deaths (Prior vs. Actual Data)**
   - **Confirmed Expectations:**
     - Your expectation that **teenagers and young adults (16-25 years old) would have a high risk** seems to align with the data. The histogram likely shows a peak in this range.
     - The **moderate risk for middle-aged adults** (26-60 years) may also be consistent with the histogram.
     - The **increase in risk for elderly individuals** due to slower reflexes and medical conditions may be reflected in the data, but possibly to a lesser extent than young adults.

   - **Unexpected Differences:**
     - If the histogram shows a **much sharper decline in risk after young adulthood** than expected, this could indicate that the elderly drive significantly less, reducing their exposure to accidents.
     - If the histogram shows **a peak in middle-aged adults**, this might suggest other factors, such as long-distance commuting or increased time spent on the road.

2. **Drug Use Deaths (Prior vs. Actual Data)**
   - **Confirmed Expectations:**
     - If the histogram shows **high deaths in young adults (15-30 years old)**, this confirms your expectation that experimentation and club culture contribute to higher drug-related mortality.
     - A **sustained but slightly lower risk for middle-aged adults (30-50 years old)** would align with the idea that long-term addiction and opioid use persist in this age group.
     - A **decline in elderly drug-related deaths**, except for prescription medication overdoses, would be expected.

   - **Unexpected Differences:**
     - If the histogram shows an **unexpected peak in middle-aged adults (40-50 years old)**, this may indicate that the opioid crisis has a greater impact on this group than initially assumed.
     - If **elderly deaths are higher than expected**, it could suggest that prescription drug misuse or overdoses are more prevalent among older adults than previously thought.
